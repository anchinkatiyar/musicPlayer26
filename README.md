Web Music Player
Project Overview
The Web Music Player is a simple, responsive music player built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
It allows users to browse and play music files from predefined playlists, offering controls such as play, pause, previous, next, and volume adjustment. 
It mimics some features of popular music streaming services with a clean and intuitive UI.

Features

Playlists: Browse and select songs from different playlists.
Playback Controls: Includes buttons for play, pause, next, and previous, as well as a seek bar and volume control.
Dynamic Song Display: The currently playing song's information and time are displayed in the playbar.
Volume Control & Mute: Users can adjust the volume and mute/unmute directly from the interface.
Hamburger Menu: A collapsible side menu with navigation options.
Dark Mode UI: The interface is styled with a sleek, dark theme for a better user experience.

Technologies Used

JavaScript: To handle playlist management, song playback, and user interactions.

How It Works
Song Selection: The user can browse through available playlists and select a song to play.
Playback Controls: The playbar at the bottom provides control over song playback, with options to play/pause, skip to the next or previous track, and adjust the volume.
Dynamic Updates: As the song plays, the seek bar updates in real-time, showing the elapsed and total time of the song.
Album Display: Playlists are displayed as album cards, showing cover art and a brief description.
